Write a function dirReduc which will take an array of strings and returns an array of strings with the needless directions removed (W<->E or S<->N side by side).

    The Haskell version takes a list of directions with data Direction = North | East | West | South.
    The Clojure version returns nil when the path is reduced to nothing.
    The Rust version takes a slice of enum Direction {North, East, West, South}.
